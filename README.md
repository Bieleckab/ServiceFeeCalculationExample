# ServiceFeeCalculationExample
Simple Spring REST API example app for calculation of transaction fees for accountant clients

# Assignment description

**User story description:**
The accountant needs to calculate efficiently fees for particular services(transactions) provided to the client. The simplest algorithm for calculation of fees is to read fixed fees defined in the fee table for each executed transaction. The calculation algorithm of particular fee might vary depending on transaction type.

**Non functional requirements:**
- Execution of logic might be triggered by REST API call
- Execution of logic can be triggered by message event
- The proposed solution needs to be easily enhanceable with new algorithms of fee calculation

**Request:**
- design the solution for implementation of REST service to calculate fee (try to explain it in a form you prefer)
- Implement the logic of user story keeping in mind the non functional requirements
